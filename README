Section 1.2: Contents

This document contains a number of sections which describe different parts of the system (hardware, software, instructions,...)

1. Introduction and setup:  Describes the use and maintenance of this document as well as provides a roadmap for use.  Some general tips for the tow tank are also included.

2. Tow tank hardware:  The main hardware components are explained here

3. Tow tank software. The software used to run and gather data from the tow tank is described here

4. PIV.  The components used for flow visualization are described here

5. Beginning Electronics for Experimentalists: This serves as a guide to electronics for experimentalists, especially those not 

6. Instrumentation for Experimentalists: A brief description of instrumentation techniques useful for the experimentalist.  This and the next section are geared towards experimentalists working in fluid mechanics

7. Actuation for Experimentalists: A description of actuation techniques useful for the experimentalist.  Microcontrollers, DC Motors, solenoids, servos, LEDs, MOSFETs and H-Bridge drivers, amplifiers, and much more will be discussed.  This section, along with sections 5 can serve as a guide to designing actuation system for experimental use.

8. Electronics Fabrication for Experimentalist:  This section describes experiential knowledge on different techniques to setup electronic apparatus for use in a lab setting.  Breadboarding, prototyping, soldering, and PCB (printed circuit board) production are discussed.

9. Purchasing: Specific vendors and purchasing techniques for everything electronic are discussed here.  Take this section with a grain of salt, as the electronics landscape changes very quickly.
